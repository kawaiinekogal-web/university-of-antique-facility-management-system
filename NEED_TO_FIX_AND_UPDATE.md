# Need to Fix and Update

Status of the known issues in [`documentation.md` §13](documentation.md#13-known-issues-and-backend-follow-ups), checked against the current code on **October 21, 2026**.

**Summary:** 12 fixed, 1 still open (#8). The agreed next steps (2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11), account deactivation, the control-number display gap, mobile navigation gap, and private local receipt uploads are fixed below.

| # | Issue | Fixed? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Repair (RM) ticket lookup | ✅ Yes | Fixed on Oct 19 and tested: the landing page tracker shows Notified, Pending, Ongoing, Success and Failed. |
| 2 | Dashboard repair counts | ✅ Yes | Admin, College and Org dashboards now count the saved `ongoing`, `success` and `failed` statuses. College counts use the shared college team IDs. |
| 3 | Deleting an account deletes its history | ✅ Yes | Admin and unit-team account actions deactivate accounts instead of deleting them. Inactive accounts cannot sign in; future facility requests and pending/upcoming bookings are marked cancelled, while past/completed activity and all history records remain intact. |
| 4 | Multiple facilities, multi-day requests, and time conflicts | ✅ Yes | College, Org, Guest, and Public forms accept one or more facilities for one day or a continuous date range. The live availability status shows booked time ranges and blocks overlaps in both the UI and server validation. Back-to-back slots and simultaneous reservations at different facilities are allowed. Approval rechecks and reserves all selected facilities for every date atomically. Requests require 30 days' notice; date ranges remain capped at 14 days. |
| 5 | PDF shows only the start date | ✅ Yes | The generated form includes the full date range and checks each selected facility's venue box. |
| 6 | Guests email their payment receipt | ✅ Yes | Public requests require a JPG/JPEG, PNG, or PDF receipt up to 10 MiB. Receipts and optional supporting uploads use a private local disk, generated filenames, MIME/size checks, and authorized download routes; deployment and backup steps are documented. |
| 7 | Landing header on phones | ✅ Yes | Checked at phone widths (320px and 390px): no sideways scroll, and all header links are available in a keyboard-accessible Menu disclosure. |
| 8 | Wrong data ("CCIS Dean") | ❌ No | John C. Amar's college is still "CCIS Dean" (should be "CCIS"), and the CEA Dean is still named "CCIS Dean" in the signatories table. |
| 9 | Wrong dashboard and Monthly Records numbers | ✅ Yes | Monthly Records now reads equipment/requester details from each booking's linked submission and builds the venue list from the facilities table. |
| 10 | Approve / Disapprove in one click | ✅ Yes | Both decisions require confirmation. Disapproval requires a reason, which is saved, shown to guests, and included in their notification. |
| 11 | Reserved requests disappear from My requests | ✅ Yes | College and Org request lists no longer exclude reserved submissions; the existing Reserved filter now returns them. |
| — | "Control No." shows the word "Pending" | ✅ Yes | Requests without a control number now display "Not assigned". |
