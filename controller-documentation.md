## 19. `TicketLookupController`
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/TicketLookupController.php`

Public controller used by the homepage tracker. The status lookup does not require authentication and is limited to 20 requests per minute.

| Method | HTTP | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `show(Request $request)` | GET | `/track/ticket` (`ticket.lookup`) | Accepts `type` (`FM`, `BK`, or `RM`), `code`, and `last_name`. New FM records use the separately stored `requester_last_name` or the account's explicit `last_name`; guest bookings resolve the linked FM submission's tracking name. Maintenance tickets use the requester's explicit account last name. Explicit values are compared as whole values after case/whitespace normalization and treating commas/periods as spaces; partial/suffix-only matches are rejected. Records without an explicit value retain legacy matching against the full name. Returns status and relevant details without requester identity. Missing names return `needs_last_name`; unmatched codes or names return the same not-found response. |
| `uploadPayment(Request $request, FormSubmission $submission)` | POST | `/track/ticket/{submission}/payment` (`ticket.payment.upload`) | Signed, rate-limited endpoint for approved guest facility requests only. Validates a JPG/JPEG, PNG, or PDF receipt up to 10 MiB, stores it on the private payment-receipts disk, and changes payment status to `payment_uploaded`. |

For an approved guest facility request, `show` may return a temporary signed PDF URL (30-minute expiry) and, when payment is still due, a temporary signed receipt-upload URL (15-minute expiry). Booking and maintenance lookups return status/details only; none of the status lookup results permit editing the underlying record.

## 23. `PublicFacilityRequestController`
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PublicFacilityRequestController.php`

| Method | HTTP | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create()` | GET | `/request-facility` | Renders the public guest request form with active public facilities. No account or sign-in is required. |
| `store(StoreFacilitiesUtilizationRequest $request)` | POST | `/request-facility` | Validates visitor details and facility-request fields, files the request under the shared non-interactive walk-in account, stores the visitor's full name and explicit tracking last name in the submission payload, and emails the tracking code. The receipt is not required at initial submission; payment may be requested after GSU review. |
| `submitted(FormSubmission $submission)` | GET | `/request-facility/submitted/{submission}` | Shows the confirmation only when the submission ID is present in the current visitor session. |

## 24. `PaymentReceiptController`
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentReceiptController.php`

| Method | HTTP | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `show(FormSubmission $submission)` | GET | `/forms/facilities/{submission}/payment-receipt` | Streams the receipt only to an admin, the authenticated requester, or the public session that submitted the request. |
| `attachment(FormSubmission $submission, int $index)` | GET | `/forms/facilities/{submission}/attachments/{index}` | Streams a supporting upload under the same authorization checks as receipt downloads. |

Downloads are private and non-cacheable. New uploads use the private `payment_receipts` disk; legacy paths are accepted only from their expected storage prefixes.
