## 9. `FormSubmission`
**File:** `app/Models/FormSubmission.php`
**Table:** `form_submissions`

### Description
Tracks a facility utilization submission through its lifecycle from pending to approved/disapproved and reservation. Public FM tracking derives its code from the submission year and ID (`FM-<year>-<id>`); it requires the submitter's last name and does not require a separate tracking-code column.

### Schema

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | bigint (auto) | PK | Primary key |
| `type` | string | required | Form type (e.g., `facilities_utilization`, `repair_maintenance`) |
| `requester_id` | bigint | FK → `users.id`, cascade delete | User who submitted the form |
| `requester_type` | string | required | Requester type: `college`, `org`, `admin`, or `guest` |

| `created_at` | timestamp | auto | Record creation time |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | auto | Record update time |

### Typical Payload Structure (facilities_utilization)
```json
{
  "control_no": null,
  "date_request": "2026-05-21",
  "requester_name": "College Staff User",
  "requester_unit": "College of Engineering",
  "date_activity": "2026-06-01",
  "time_range": { "start": "08:00", "end": "12:00" },
  "facility_id": 3,
  "venue_others": null,
  "purpose": "Seminar on AI",
  "equipment": {
    "monobloc_chair": 50,
    "table": 5,
    "electric_fan": 3,
    "rostrum": 1,
    "flag": 0,
    "sound": 1,
    "led": 0
  }
}
```

Public guest submissions use `requester_type=guest` and are linked to a shared walk-in account; the visitor's actual name is stored in the payload. The public tracker checks the supplied surname against `requester_name`, `client_name`, and, when applicable, the associated requester's account name. A matching FM lookup returns status and relevant schedule details, not requester identity. Only approved guest facility submissions may receive temporary signed PDF/payment action URLs.

### Fillable
`type`, `requester_id`, `requester_type`, `requester_unit`, `status`, `payload`

### Casts
- `payload` → `array`

### Relationships
| Relationship | Type | Related Model | Foreign Key | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `requester()` | belongsTo | `User` | `requester_id` | The user who submitted the form |

### Traits

| `created_at` | timestamp | auto | Record creation time |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | auto | Record update time |
