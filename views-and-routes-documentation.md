# Views & Routes Documentation — UA Facility Management System

**Validated:** October 26, 2026. The route tables describe the current web routes; verify `routes/web.php` or run `php artisan route:list` for the authoritative live list. Retired guest portal templates may remain in the repository, but the current guest workflow is public and does not use guest sign-in.

## Routes

**File:** `routes/web.php`

Routes are defined in `routes/web.php`. Staff routes use session authentication and role middleware; public routes are listed separately.

### Repair and maintenance ticket routes

Staff ticket routes are protected by `auth` and the corresponding role middleware. Public status lookup uses `GET /track/ticket?type=RM&code=...&last_name=...` and does not require sign-in.

| GET | `/admin/maintenance-tickets/{ticket}` | `admin.maintenance-tickets.show` | Admin ticket detail |

Reusable sidebar partial included by all role-specific layouts. Renders navigation dynamically from a `$sections` array.

## Public Views

### `welcome.blade.php`
**Path:** `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
**Route:** `GET /` → `home`
**Layout:** `layouts.app`

The public landing page and reservation calendar. It includes a no-sign-in tracker for facility requests, bookings, and maintenance tickets.

**Features:**
- Public tracker accepts Facility (FM), Booking (BK; code prefix `BKG-`), or Maintenance (RM).
- Requires the tracking code and the submitter's tracking last name. New accounts and guest facility requests store this value separately; the application does not infer it from the full name. Explicit values are compared as whole values after case/spacing normalization (commas and periods are treated as spaces); records without one retain legacy matching. A mismatch does not reveal whether the record exists.
- Shows status and relevant request/schedule details without exposing requester identity. Lookup results are read-only for internal records.
- Approved guest facility requests may show temporary signed PDF and payment-receipt actions when applicable; receipt upload is handled by the signed `ticket.payment.upload` route.
- Rate-limited JSON lookup: `GET /track/ticket` (`ticket.lookup`, 20 requests/minute).
- The tracker uses a two-row desktop search card and stacks its fields on narrow screens.
- Month navigation (Prev / Next links)
- 7-column calendar grid (Mon–Sun) displaying bookings per day
- Each booking card shows: facility name, time range, purpose (truncated to 60 chars)
- Only `reserved` and `rescheduled` bookings are shown
- Displays unavailable/maintenance facilities and selected-day booking details.
- Calendar data: `$currentMonth` (Carbon), `$days` (array keyed by date string → bookings), `$unavailableFacilities`, `$selectedDate`, and `$selectedDateBookings`.
